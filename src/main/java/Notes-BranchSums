What is Depth first search?

In this traversal first the deepest node with no subnodes will be visited. Then
we will back track to its parent.

Therefore, the Depth First Traversals of Tree will be:
(a) Inorder (Left, Root, Right) : 4 2 5 1 3
(b) Preorder (Root, Left, Right) : 1 2 4 5 3
(c) Postorder (Left, Right, Root) : 4 5 2 3 1
